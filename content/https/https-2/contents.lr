description:
The short answer is: **Yes, you can browse normal HTTPS sites using Tor.**

HTTPS Connections are used to secure communications over computer networks.
You can [read more about HTTPS here](https://tb-manual.torproject.org/secure-connections/).
Tor Browser's [HTTPS-Only mode](https://tb-manual.torproject.org/secure-connections/#https-only-mode-in-tor-browser) automatically switches thousands of sites from unencrypted "HTTP" to more private "HTTPS".
