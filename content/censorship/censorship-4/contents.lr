If you have exhausted general [troubleshooting](https://tb-manual.torproject.org/troubleshooting/) steps, it's possible that your connection to Tor is censored.
In that case, connecting with one of the [built-in censorship circumvention](https://tb-manual.torproject.org/circumvention/) methods in Tor Browser can help.
[Connection Assist](https://tb-manual.torproject.org/running-tor-browser/) can automatically choose one for you using your location.

If Connection Assist is unable to facilitate the connection to Tor, you can configure Tor Browser to use one of the built-in circumvention methods manually.
To use bridges and access other censorship circumvention related settings, click "Configure Connection" when starting Tor Browser for the first time.
In the "Bridges" section, locate the option "Choose from one of Tor Browser's built-in bridges" and click on the "Select a built-In bridge" option.
From the menu, select a [censorship circumvention method](https://tb-manual.torproject.org/circumvention/) you would like to use.

Or, if you have Tor Browser running, click on "Settings" in the hamburger menu (â‰¡) and then on "Connection" in the sidebar.
In the "Bridges" section, locate the option "Choose from one of Tor Browser's built-in bridges" and click on the "Select a built-In bridge" option.
Choose whichever censorship circumvention method you would like to use from the menu.
Your settings will automatically be saved once you close the tab.

If you need other bridges, you can get them from our [Bridges website](https://bridges.torproject.org/).
For more information about bridges, please refer to the [Tor Browser user manual](https://tb-manual.torproject.org/bridges).
