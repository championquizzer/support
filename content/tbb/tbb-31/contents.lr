description:
Tor Browser is currently available on [Windows](https://www.torproject.org/download/), [Linux](https://www.torproject.org/download/), [macOS](https://www.torproject.org/download/), and [Android](https://www.torproject.org/download/#android).

On Android, [The Guardian Project](https://guardianproject.info) also provides the [Orbot app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.torproject.android) to route other apps on your Android device over the Tor network.

There is no official version of Tor Browser for iOS yet, as explained in [this blog post](https://blog.torproject.org/tor-heart-onion-browser-and-more-ios-tor/). Our best available recommendation is [Onion Browser](https://onionbrowser.com/).
