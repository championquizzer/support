description:

Sure! We have a [list of organizations that run Tor relays](https://community.torproject.org/relay/community-resources/relay-associations/) that are happy to turn your donations into better speed and anonymity for the Tor network.

These organizations are not the same as [The Tor Project, Inc](https://donate.torproject.org/), but we consider that a good thing.
They're run by nice people who are part of the Tor community.

Note that there can be a tradeoff here between anonymity and performance.
The Tor network's anonymity comes in part from diversity, so if you are in a position to run your own relay, you will be improving Tor's anonymity more than by donating.
At the same time though, economies of scale for bandwidth mean that combining many small donations into several larger relays is more efficient at improving network performance.
Improving anonymity and improving performance are both worthwhile goals, so however you can help is great!
